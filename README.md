A bot that moves users from one voice channel to another. Including locked and hidden voice channels!

## We currently got 3 commands that all move users in different ways.

#### !cmove: Moves users spread across multiple voice channels to one without the need of joining a voice channel, this command listens to bots so you can automate movement! 
Example command: `!cmove channel#1 @Fragstealern#2543 @user2`.

#### !move: Moves @mentions of users inside the Moveer voice channel to you
Example command `!move @Fragstealern#2453`
Fragstealern is required to be inside the “Moveer” voice channel.

#### !gmove: Moves users inside  GmoveerX to you with one command
Example command `!gmove overwatch`
Moves users inside “gMoveerOverwatch” voice channel to you.

### !fmove: Moves users inside one voicechannel to another
Example command `!fmove overwatch pubg`
Moves users inside overwatch to pubg.
